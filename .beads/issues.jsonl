NTM robot outputs being available and stable\n2. tmux metadata polling being cheap enough\n3. WSL localhost connectivity being reliable\n4. Command latency being predictable\n\nIf any of these assumptions are wrong, the architecture needs to change. Better to discover that now.\n\n## Key Deliverables\n1. **Transport Decision**: One chosen default (stdio) + one tested fallback\n2. **Performance Baseline**: Measured CPU + command latency distribution (p50/p95/p99)\n3. **Fixture Corpus**: Real session data for parser/detector golden tests\n4. **Fuzz Harness**: Parser resilience against malformed input\n\n## Exit Criteria\n- [ ] stdio real-time push validated without relying on WSL localhost forwarding\n- [ ] Command latency measured: tmux < 2s p99, ntm < 10s p99\n- [ ] CPU baseline: <1% on 20 sessions × 6 panes\n- [ ] Fixture corpus committed with at least 10 diverse session samples\n- [ ] Parser fuzz harness passes 10k iterations without panic\n\n## Technical Context\nThe daemon will spawn external processes (tmux, ntm, wsl.exe) frequently. These are the main failure modes:\n- Hung processes blocking the async runtime\n- Inconsistent output formats across versions\n- WSL networking flakiness (localhost:port not forwarding)\n\nThis phase surfaces these problems before we've built features on top.\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - this is the foundation","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-24T22:23:16.496845825Z","created_by":"agent","updated_at":"2026-01-24T22:23:16.496845825Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["epic","foundation","phase-minus1"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-2ml.1","depends_on_id":"bd-2ml","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-24T22:23:16.496845825Z","created_by":"agent","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}
